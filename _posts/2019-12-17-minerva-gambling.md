Gambling has existed for millennia and has taken on many forms. Humankind has always been accompanied by dices, first as predictors of natural events and the will of the gods, then as a  recreational game.

>**But what are the real probabilities of winning?**

## Definition of Probability

Probability is the branch of mathematics concerning numerical descriptions of how likely an event is to occur, or how likely it is that a proposition is true. The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1. The number **0** indicates **impossibility** of the event, while **1** indicates **certainty**. The higher the probability of an event, the more likely it is that the event will occur. In particular, the probability of an event is computed as the ratio of favorable to unfavorable outcomes.

## The Expected Value

In statistics and probability, the expected value is calculated by multiplying each of the possible outcomes by the likelihood each outcome will occur and then summing all of those values. This quantity can be seen as the average premium that a player.

This is a very important value that tells us how much is the sum we would win by playing the considered game repeatedly (for a very high number of times). Indeed, the large numbers theorem states that if the same experiment or study is repeated independently a large number of times, then the average of the results of the trials must be close to the expected value. The result becomes closer to the expected value as the number of trials is increased.




## Fair vs unfair games

A game is defined as **fair** when the money spent to play it is then all redistributed to the players in the form of prize pools.

If, on the other hand, part of the money collected is withheld by the game organizer, it will be referred to as an **unfair** game.

### How to establish if a game is fair?

Putting together the acquired information now, we can calculate the **Equity Index** (or **Payout**), to discover if a game is fair or not. If any Game has an equity rating of 1, then that game will be
fair, while if its payout is lower than 1, then it is an unfair game.

The Equity Index is defined as the ratio of the Expected Value to the price of a single bet.


#### Example 1: Coin flipping

To better understand the fairness of a game, we can take the classic Head or Tails game as an example.
Let's suppose two people decide to bet one euro each on a single toss.

### Example 2: A famous Italian game


## Super-jackpot lottery


## Misconceptions and common mistakes

### Error of representativity

It consists of assigning a greater probability to an event rather than to another because it seems to better represent the set of possible outcomes, even if the outcomes are equiprobable.

### Error of recency

It consists of assigning a greater probability to one event rather than another based on information obtained from past experiments, even if the results are independent of previous ones.

## Data in Italy

In Italy, in 2017, 20.4 billion Euros were spent on gambling. In 2016, an average of 385 Euros per capita was lost by the Italian adult population. And 53.8% of the money was spent on appliances, such as AWP, VLT, and others [1].

## Conclusions

- The dealer always wins, precisely by the very nature of games of chance (unfairness)

- A long-term investment in gambling leads to a loss of money in a percentage equal to: `1 - payout`

- There are some fallacious reasoning that leads us to overestimate the probability of a certain event happening
