Gambling has existed for millennia and has taken on many forms. Humankind has always been accompanied by dices, first as predictors of natural events and the will of the gods, then as a  recreational game.

>**But what are the real probabilities of winning?**

## Definition of Probability

Probability is the branch of mathematics concerning numerical descriptions of how likely an event is to occur, or how likely it is that a proposition is true. The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1, where, roughly speaking, **0** indicates **impossibility** of the event and **1** indicates **certainty**. The higher the probability of an event, the more likely it is that the event will occur. In particular, the probability of an event is computed as the ratio of favourable to unfavourable outcomes.

## Fair vs unfair games

A game is defined as **fair** when the money spent to play it is then all redistributed to the players in the form of prize pools.

If, on the other hand, part of the money collected is withheld by the game organizer, it will be referred to as an **unfair** game.



## Coin flipping

To better understand the fairness of a game, we can take the classic Head or Tails game as an example.
We, therefore, decide to bet one euro each on a single toss.

## Misconceptions and common mistakes

### Error of representativity

It consists of assigning a greater probability to an event rather than to another because it seems to better represent the set of possible outcomes, even if the outcomes are equiprobable.

### Error of recency

It consists of assigning a greater probability to one event rather than another based on information obtained from past experiments, even if the results are independent of previous ones.

## Data in Italy

In Italy, in 2017, 20.4 billion Euros were spent on gambling.

In 2016, an average of 385 Euros per capita was lost by the adult population.

53.8% of the money is spent on appliances, such as AWP, VLT, and others.

## Conclusions

- The dealer always wins, precisely by the very nature of games of chance (unfairness)

- A long-term investment in gambling leads to a loss of money in a percentage equal to: `1 - payout`

- There are some fallacious reasoning that leads us to overestimate the probability of a certain event happening
